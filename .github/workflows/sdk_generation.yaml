            ## Automated workflow.lock Revert
            
            This PR reverts `.speakeasy/workflow.lock` to its state at the last GA release tag: **${{ steps.find-tag.outputs.last_ga_tag }}**
            
            ### Purpose
            This ensures the SDK generation workflow uses the same workflow lock file version as the last stable GA release.
            
            ### Auto-merge
            This PR will be automatically merged to proceed with the GA release workflow.
